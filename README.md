# Model-interpretability-using-LIME
The goal here is to use a classifier ML model and check the trained model on the test dataset to capture whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The objective here is also to try and interpret the results in a more transparent way rather than just taking the results of the “black box” ML model at face value.
